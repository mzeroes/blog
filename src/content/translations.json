        "I got my first taste of coding back in high school when I didn't even have a computer at home. Instead, I used to head to the school computer lab during lunch breaks and free time to experiment with basic C++. My crowning achievement at the time was building a 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' game for a school project. It might not have been the most advanced game, but it was a start.",
        "Fast forward to my 10th grade when I attended a hacking workshop at DTU. That's when the cybersecurity bug bit me, and I knew I was in for an exciting ride in the world of computer science. It set the stage for my next step, enrolling in a Bachelor's program in Information Technology at MAIT, New Delhi.",
        "During my college years, I landed an internship at Grappus, and that's where the real learning began. From intern to Full Stack Developer, I dabbled in a variety of projects and wore many different hats. The experience was a rollercoaster, but it also gave me a lot of valuable skills and some awesome friendships.",

And as for what's next, I'm on the lookout for my next big adventure in the tech world. I'm excited to see where the road takes me and to keep learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.",
